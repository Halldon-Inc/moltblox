### Detailed Breakdowns

#### BLUR (NFT Marketplace)

- **Launch:** Feb 14, 2023 via airdrop (Care Packages)
- **Total Supply:** 3 billion
- **Initial Circulation:** 360M tokens (12%)
- **Price Action:** Spiked to $5+ then settled around $0.65 within 24 hours as airdrop recipients sold
- **Token Allocation:** 51% community, 29% contributors (4-year vest), 19% investors (4-year vest), 1% advisors
- **Lesson:** 12% float with heavy airdrop = immediate sell pressure. The high community allocation was good for narrative but created dump dynamics at launch.

#### IMX (Immutable X, Gaming L2)

- **Launch:** July 2021 via token sale
- **Total Supply:** 2 billion
- **Initial Circulation:** ~18M tokens (~0.9%)
- **Price Action:** Started around $0.30, hit ATH of $9.52 in Nov 2021 (x31)
- **Token Allocation:** 51.74% ecosystem, 25% project dev, 14.26% private sale, 5% public sale, 4% foundation
- **Lesson:** Ultra-low float (0.9%) created massive upside potential but also extreme volatility. Most gains were during the 2021 bull; has since lost 98%+ from ATH.

#### GALA (Gala Games)

- **Launch:** Sep 11, 2020 via node emissions (no ICO)
- **Total Supply:** 50 billion (originally higher before 20.9B burn in May 2023)
- **Initial Circulation:** ~7B tokens (~14%)
- **Price Action:** Started at $0.0003, ATH of $0.83 (x2,766)
- **Unique Model:** No token sale; all tokens emitted through Founder's Node operators (50/50 split with Gala Games)
- **Lesson:** No ICO model builds strong community narrative ("fairly launched"). Massive supply (50B) makes the token feel cheap and accessible. The May 2023 burn of 20.9B tokens (~$660M) was critical for price stabilization.

#### PRIME (Echelon Prime, Gaming)

- **Launch:** March 2023 (unlocked via community vote; initially non-transferable from Jul 2022)
- **Total Supply:** 111.1M
- **Initial Circulation:** ~36M tokens (~32%)
- **Price Action:** Started ~$1.50, ATH $28.20 (x18.8)
- **Token Allocation:** 31.7% gameplay pool, 19.7% Parallel Studios reserve, 16.2% investors, 14.1% caching, 11.19% foundation, 7.11% events
- **Lesson:** Higher float (32%) with a genuine gaming product (Parallel) led to more organic price discovery. The gameplay pool (31.7%) for P2E was a strong incentive alignment.

#### PIXEL (Pixels Gaming)

- **Launch:** Feb 2024 via Binance Launchpool
- **Total Supply:** 5 billion
- **Initial Circulation:** ~771M tokens (~15.4%)
- **Price Action:** Launchpool FDV was ~$5.42M. ATH $1.02 shortly after major exchange listing. Now $0.005 (-99%)
- **Lesson:** Binance Launchpool provided massive initial distribution and visibility. However, the 5B total supply at sub-cent prices made FDV calculations deceptive. Price collapsed after initial hype cycle.

#### AXS (Axie Infinity)

- **Launch:** Nov 4, 2020 via Binance Launchpad IEO
- **Total Supply:** 270M
- **Initial Circulation:** ~60M tokens (~22.2%)
- **ICO Price:** $0.10
- **Price Action:** ATH $165.93 in Nov 2021 (x1,659 from ICO). Currently $1.33.
- **Amount Raised:** ~$3M
- **Lesson:** The gold standard for gaming token launches. Moderate float (22%), accessible price ($0.10), genuine product-market fit (P2E boom). The combination of a real game + reasonable valuation created legendary returns. However, unsustainable P2E economics led to eventual collapse.

#### HYPE (Hyperliquid)

- **Launch:** Nov 29, 2024 via airdrop
- **Total Supply:** 1 billion
- **Initial Circulation:** ~333M tokens (~33%)
- **Price Action:** Debuted at $3.20, rose to $4.18 in first hour. Currently $28.73 (+798%)
- **Unique Factor:** No VC funding. 31% airdropped to community. 97% of fees used for buyback.
- **Lesson:** The outlier success story of 2024-2025. Higher float (33%) combined with genuine product usage + no VC unlock pressure + deflationary buyback = sustained price appreciation. This is the model to emulate.

#### Base Chain Token Launches (Notable)

- **BRETT (Memecoin):** Launched Feb 2024. Fully diluted from day one. Hit $2B market cap. No vesting = no unlock pressure.
- **VIRTUAL (AI Agent Platform):** Launched Oct 2024. Key utility token for AI agent economy on Base.
- **AERO (Aerodrome):** DEX/AMM token with 360M circulating supply. The liquidity hub of Base ecosystem.
- **Zora Coins:** Every post = ERC-20 token with 1B supply. Creator gets 10M (1% float). 50% of trading fees to creator.

## 2. The Low Float / High FDV Debate (2024-2026 Meta)

### The Data Is Clear: Low FDV Wins

Research from Memento Research tracking 118 token launches in 2025:

| FDV at TGE   | % Still Profitable | Median Return | Verdict           |
| ------------ | ------------------ | ------------- | ----------------- |
| $25M - $200M | 40% still green    | Positive      | Best performers   |
| $200M - $1B  | ~15% green         | Negative      | Declining returns |
| > $1B        | 0% green           | -81% median   | Complete failure  |

**Key finding:** "The bigger the FDV debut, the worse the drawdown."

### Why High FDV Tokens Fail

1. **Private capture:** VCs bid up valuations in seed/Series A rounds, capturing most upside before public launch
2. **Supply/demand mismatch:** Token emissions are rigidly scheduled while demand fluctuates unpredictably
3. **Unlock sell pressure:** Time-scheduled unlocks create predictable selling events that suppress price
4. **No room to grow:** When FDV is already $1B+ at launch, there's limited upside narrative for new buyers

### What Works Now (2025-2026 Meta)

1. **Fair launch / High float:** More tokens circulating from day one = less future dilution fear
2. **Low FDV ($25M-$200M range):** Room for price discovery and organic growth
3. **No VC or minimal VC:** Removes unlock pressure (see: HYPE, memecoins)
4. **Deflationary mechanics:** Buybacks, burns, gas consumption create organic demand
5. **Community-first distribution:** Airdrops/rewards over private sales
6. **Full dilution from launch (memecoin model):** PEPE, WIF, BRETT all outperformed VC tokens by launching fully diluted

### The Moltblox Advantage

MBUCKS has no VC funding (self-funded by Halldon Inc.), which means:

- No investor unlock schedules to worry about
- No pressure to launch at inflated valuations
- Freedom to choose a community-friendly distribution model
- Similar positioning to HYPE and GALA (no external funding)

## 3. MBUCKS Launch Scenarios ($10K LP)

### Assumptions

- Total supply: 1,000,000,000 (1B) MBUCKS
- Liquidity pool: $10,000 total ($5,000 MBUCKS + $5,000 USDC)
- AMM model: Constant product (x \* y = k), Uniswap V2 style on Base
- Price per token = $5,000 / tokens_in_pool
- Initial market cap = price per token x circulating supply
- FDV = price per token x 1,000,000,000

### Scenario Calculations

#### Scenario A: 1% Float (10M tokens circulating)

| Metric             | Value      |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Tokens in LP       | 10,000,000 |
| USDC in LP         | $5,000     |
| Price per token    | $0.0005    |
| Initial Market Cap | $5,000     |
| FDV                | $500,000   |
| MCap/FDV Ratio     | 0.01       |

**Problem:** $5K market cap is microscopic. A single $100 buy moves price significantly. FDV of $500K is ultra-conservative but may signal "toy project."

#### Scenario B: 2% Float (20M tokens circulating)

| Metric             | Value      |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Tokens in LP       | 20,000,000 |
| USDC in LP         | $5,000     |
| Price per token    | $0.00025   |
| Initial Market Cap | $5,000     |
| FDV                | $250,000   |
| MCap/FDV Ratio     | 0.02       |

**Problem:** Even lower price per token, lower FDV. Feels extremely cheap, which can be good (accessible) or bad (unserious).

#### Scenario C: 3% Float (30M tokens circulating)

| Metric             | Value      |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Tokens in LP       | 30,000,000 |
| USDC in LP         | $5,000     |
| Price per token    | $0.000167  |
| Initial Market Cap | $5,000     |
| FDV                | $166,667   |
| MCap/FDV Ratio     | 0.03       |

**Problem:** Sub-$200K FDV. Almost no token has sustained relevance at this level.

#### Scenario D: 5% Float (50M tokens circulating)

| Metric             | Value      |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Tokens in LP       | 50,000,000 |
| USDC in LP         | $5,000     |
| Price per token    | $0.0001    |
| Initial Market Cap | $5,000     |
| FDV                | $100,000   |
| MCap/FDV Ratio     | 0.05       |

**Problem:** $100K FDV is extremely small. Even micro-cap tokens rarely start this low. Price is 4 zeroes after decimal.

#### Scenario E: 10% Float (100M tokens circulating)

| Metric             | Value       |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Tokens in LP       | 100,000,000 |
| USDC in LP         | $5,000      |
| Price per token    | $0.00005    |
| Initial Market Cap | $5,000      |
| FDV                | $50,000     |
| MCap/FDV Ratio     | 0.10        |

**Problem:** $50K FDV is below even most memecoins at launch.

#### Scenario F: 15% Float (150M tokens circulating)

| Metric             | Value       |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| Tokens in LP       | 150,000,000 |
| USDC in LP         | $5,000      |
| Price per token    | $0.0000333  |
| Initial Market Cap | $5,000      |
| FDV                | $33,333     |
| MCap/FDV Ratio     | 0.15        |

**Problem:** FDV of $33K. 5 zeroes after decimal. Practically invisible on any tracker.

### Critical Observation

**In ALL scenarios, the initial market cap is $5,000** because the pool only has $5,000 worth of tokens regardless of the float percentage. The float percentage only affects the price per token and the FDV. With $10K total liquidity:

- More tokens in pool = lower price per token = lower FDV
- Fewer tokens in pool = higher price per token = higher FDV
- Market cap always equals pool-side value ($5K) at launch

This means **the float percentage primarily affects FDV optics and price-per-token psychology**, not the actual market cap at launch.

### Summary Table

| Float % | Circ. Supply | Price/Token | MCap   | FDV      | MCap/FDV |
| ------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------ | -------- | -------- |
| 1%      | 10M          | $0.0005     | $5,000 | $500,000 | 0.01     |
| 2%      | 20M          | $0.00025    | $5,000 | $250,000 | 0.02     |
| 3%      | 30M          | $0.000167   | $5,000 | $166,667 | 0.03     |
| 5%      | 50M          | $0.0001     | $5,000 | $100,000 | 0.05     |
| 10%     | 100M         | $0.00005    | $5,000 | $50,000  | 0.10     |
| 15%     | 150M         | $0.0000333  | $5,000 | $33,333  | 0.15     |

## 4. Price Impact Analysis

Using the constant product formula (x \* y = k) with a $10K pool ($5K USDC + tokens):

### Price Impact for a $100 Buy

Price impact formula: `price_impact = dX / (X + dX)` where dX = buy amount (USDC), X = USDC reserve.

| Buy Size | USDC Reserve | Price Impact | New Price (1% float) | New Price (5% float) |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------ | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| $100     | $5,000       | ~2.0%        | $0.000510            | $0.000102            |
| $500     | $5,000       | ~9.1%        | $0.000545            | $0.000109            |
| $1,000   | $5,000       | ~16.7%       | $0.000600            | $0.000120            |
| $2,500   | $5,000       | ~33.3%       | $0.000750            | $0.000150            |
| $5,000   | $5,000       | ~50.0%       | $0.001000            | $0.000200            |

### Detailed Calculations (1% Float, $0.0005 start price)

**$100 Buy:**

- USDC reserve: $5,000; Token reserve: 10,000,000
- k = 5,000 \* 10,000,000 = 50,000,000,000
- After fee: $99.70 USDC deposited
- New USDC reserve: $5,099.70
- New token reserve: 50,000,000,000 / 5,099.70 = 9,804,471
- Tokens received: 195,529 MBUCKS
- Effective price: $100 / 195,529 = $0.000511
- **Slippage: ~2.3%**

**$500 Buy:**

- After fee: $498.50 USDC deposited
- New USDC reserve: $5,498.50
- New token reserve: 50,000,000,000 / 5,498.50 = 9,093,390
- Tokens received: 906,610 MBUCKS
- Effective price: $500 / 906,610 = $0.000551
- **Slippage: ~10.3%**

**$1,000 Buy:**

- After fee: $997 USDC deposited
- New USDC reserve: $5,997
- New token reserve: 50,000,000,000 / 5,997 = 8,337,502
- Tokens received: 1,662,498 MBUCKS
- Effective price: $1,000 / 1,662,498 = $0.000602
- **Slippage: ~20.3%**

### What This Means

With only $5,000 of USDC in the pool:

- **$100 buy:** Acceptable slippage (~2.3%). Fine for retail exploration.
- **$500 buy:** High slippage (~10.3%). Noticeable but tolerable for early supporters.
- **$1,000 buy:** Very high slippage (~20.3%). Buyers are paying a 20% premium. Uncomfortable.
- **$2,500+ buy:** Extreme slippage (33%+). Essentially impossible to make large purchases efficiently.

**This is independent of float percentage.** The slippage is determined by the USDC side of the pool ($5,000), not by how many tokens are in it.

## 5. Pros and Cons by Tier

### 1% Float (10M tokens, FDV $500K)

| Pros                                                      | Cons                                                       |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Highest price per token ($0.0005) feels like "real money" | 99% of supply locked creates massive future dilution fear  |
| $500K FDV is reasonable and has room to grow              | MCap/FDV ratio of 0.01 is the worst in the 2025 data       |
| Easiest "100x narrative" (FDV only needs to reach $50M)   | Exactly the low-float/high-FDV pattern the market punishes |
| Scarcity creates FOMO                                     | Very few tokens available for rewards/airdrops             |

### 2-3% Float (20-30M tokens, FDV $167K-$250K)

| Pros                                                   | Cons                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| More tokens available for rewards/ecosystem            | FDV feels very small for a platform token  |
| Slightly higher float = slightly less dilution concern | Still firmly in low-float territory        |
| Price per token still readable (3-4 zeroes)            | Hard to list on any aggregator at this FDV |

### 5% Float (50M tokens, FDV $100K)

| Pros                                                    | Cons                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Balanced: meaningful rewards pool + scarcity            | $100K FDV barely registers on any tracker |
| 5% is a common early-stage float                        | Price at $0.0001 (4 zeroes) looks micro   |
| MCap/FDV of 0.05 is in the "winning zone" per 2025 data | Still high dilution risk perception       |

### 10-15% Float (100-150M tokens, FDV $33K-$50K)

| Pros                                          | Cons                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| More "fair launch" optics                     | FDV is too small to be taken seriously              |
| More tokens for ecosystem rewards immediately | Price per token has 5+ zeroes                       |
| Higher MCap/FDV ratio (healthier perception)  | Impossible to get listed anywhere at $33K FDV       |
| Less dilution concern                         | Looks like a random memecoin, not a gaming platform |

### Token Price Psychology

| Price Range  | Perception                   | Example                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| $0.001-$0.01 | "Cheap, I can buy millions"  | SHIB, PEPE vibes. Accessible but unserious   |
| $0.01-$0.10  | "Early stage, could 10-100x" | Sweet spot for gaming tokens (AXS was $0.10) |
| $0.10-$1.00  | "Real token, legit project"  | Most established gaming tokens trade here    |
| $1.00+       | "Expensive, maybe I'm late"  | Only after significant traction              |

With $10K LP, getting MBUCKS to the $0.01-$0.10 range would require:

- At $0.01: only 500,000 tokens in pool. 0.05% float on 1B supply. Not realistic.
- At $0.001: 5,000,000 tokens in pool. 0.5% float on 1B supply. Extremely low.

**The hard truth:** With $10K liquidity and 1B total supply, the token will necessarily trade at sub-cent prices regardless of float.

## 6. Recommendation

### The Core Problem

$10K of liquidity is extremely thin for a 1B token supply. Every float option results in:

- Sub-cent token prices
- $5K market cap
- High slippage on any meaningful trade

### Recommended Approach: 5% Float with Growth Plan

**Phase 1: Stealth Launch (5% float = 50M tokens)**

- Price: $0.0001 per MBUCKS
- FDV: $100,000
- MCap: $5,000
- Target audience: Core community, game builders, early testers only
- Purpose: Establish price discovery, build organic trading volume
- Duration: 2-4 weeks

**Phase 2: Community Expansion**

- Add more liquidity as revenue/interest grows (target $50K LP)
- At $50K LP with 5% float: FDV = $500K, price = $0.0005
- Begin rewards distribution (additional 5% over 3 months = 10% total float)
- Enable in-game purchases and burns

**Phase 3: Growth**

- Target $100K-$500K LP via LP incentives and trading fees
- At $250K LP with 10% float: FDV = $1.25M, price = $0.0025
- Apply for DEX aggregator listings (Jupiter equivalents on Base)

### Why 5% Float

1. **Matches the winning tier:** $25M-$200M FDV tokens outperformed in 2025 data. At $100K starting FDV, MBUCKS has enormous room to grow into that range.
2. **Preserves tokens for rewards:** 95% of supply remains for Builder Score, Player Score, Holder Score, airdrops, and treasury.
3. **AXS precedent:** AXS launched at $0.10 with 22% float and $6M MCap from a $3M raise. Scaled to $165+ during the gaming boom. Proportionally, starting at $5K MCap with a $10K LP is the same relative energy at a much smaller scale.
4. **GALA precedent:** Started at $0.0003 with ~14% float and no ICO (pure node emissions). The ultra-low price made it feel accessible. Ran to $0.83.
5. **Avoids the high-FDV trap:** 1% float = $500K FDV with $5K MCap creates a 100:1 MCap/FDV ratio that screams "future dump." 5% float at $100K FDV is much healthier.
6. **Enough tokens for initial ecosystem:** 50M tokens = enough for initial rewards, in-game purchases, and builder incentives.

### Token Allocation Within the 5% Float

| Purpose | Tokens     | % of Float | % of Total |
| ------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| LP Seed | 50,000,000 | 100%       | 5%         |

The remaining 95% (950M tokens) would be allocated per the tokenomics model (task #4), but NOT circulating at launch. They would enter circulation through:

- Rewards/points system (seasons)
- Game builder earnings
- Player earnings
- Staking rewards
- Airdrops
- Team/treasury (with transparent vesting)

### Mitigating the $10K LP Problem

$10K is genuinely very small. Strategies to grow it:

1. **Protocol-owned liquidity (POL):** Route a percentage of in-game purchase fees to LP growth
2. **LP incentive program:** Reward users who add liquidity with boosted points
3. **Aerodrome/Base DEX incentives:** Apply for Aerodrome gauge voting to attract external liquidity
4. **Trading fee reinvestment:** 100% of trading fees go back into LP for the first 3 months
5. **Buyback mechanism:** Like HYPE's 97% fee buyback, use platform revenue to buy MBUCKS and add to LP
6. **Community LP rounds:** Offer boosted airdrop multipliers for users who add liquidity

### Price Targets for Context

| Milestone      | Price   | MCap (5% float) | FDV   | LP Needed |
| -------------- | ------- | --------------- | ----- | --------- |
| Launch         | $0.0001 | $5K             | $100K | $10K      |
| Early Traction | $0.001  | $50K            | $1M   | ~$100K    |
| Growing        | $0.01   | $500K           | $10M  | ~$1M      |
| Established    | $0.10   | $5M             | $100M | ~$10M     |
| Success        | $1.00   | $50M            | $1B   | ~$100M    |

Each 10x in price roughly requires a 10x increase in liquidity to maintain reasonable slippage.
